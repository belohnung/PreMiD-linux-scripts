# PreMiD Install Scripts for Linux
---
## What is this?
PreMiD adds Discord Rich Presence integration, media controls and much more to your beloved services. https://premid.app/

In this repository, I've included scripts to make it easier to install PreMiD on Linux as their website currently does not provide an installer for Linux. 

## How to install
Copy and paste this in your terminal emulator. You can (and should!) inspect the script before running it on this repository.

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlimShadyIAm/PreMiD-linux-scripts/master/install.sh | bash

## How to uninstall
Copy and paste this in your terminal emulator. You can (and should!) inspect the script before running it on this repository.
